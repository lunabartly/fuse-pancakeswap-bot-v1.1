# About Fuse Pancake Swap Bot

Decentralized market is too volatile to trade, So I have come up with this BOT so you can get more profit by selling and buying tokens at better prices, also the trade will be executed in seconds.

Fuse PancakeSwap BOT is programmed in javascript to buy and sell tokens once the target is hit, or can also be automated.

Let me know if you get unexpected errors so that I can update the code because it has a lot of scenarios to cover.
